Animation based on Eadweard Muybridges Work

I build a little sprite sheet here in Gimp and moved this PNG Sequence with JS Interval.


Eadweard Muybridge is known for his pioneering chronophotography of animal locomotion 
between 1878 and 1886, which used multiple cameras to capture the different positions in a stride.


For me this early development of sequential photo series owns a lot of magic.
Its like a little sketch for all what follows after this, 
scientific photography, cinemathography and animation.


In the original Sequence there is a rider on the horse.

I prefered the horse without a human being on his back.

its wild ...its free ... its running ... hey ho silver!
